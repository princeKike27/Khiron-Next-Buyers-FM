# Next Buyers *K* Classifier

For this project I analyzed data from patients that have been prescribed with FMs. By using a Logistic Regression Algorithm I created a next-buyer classifier that based on patient features like its age, sex, diagnosis, city and type of product will classify a patient as a buyer or non buyer.

Throught the project you will be able to find:

- Data cleaning and standardization.
- Analysis of relevant features to build the model.
- Logistic Regression Model for patient classification.
- Analysis of model's performance.
- Model testing.
- Creation of Web App to visualize model - Poland House Price Calculator.
