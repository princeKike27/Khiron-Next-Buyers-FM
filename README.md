# Prediction of Next Buyers from patients prescribed with FMs

For this project I analyzed data from patients that have been prescribed with FMs. I created a Logistic Regression Model that predicts which patients prescribed with FM bought the product, based on features like their sex, age, city, diagnosis and type of product prescribed.

Throught the project you will be able to find:

    Data cleaning and standardization.
    Analysis of relevant features to build the model.
    Logistic Regression Model for patient classification.
    Analysis of model's performance.
    Model testing.
